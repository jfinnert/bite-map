# Test Suite Analysis

## Current Status

The Bite Map test suite currently has mixed results:

- **Working Tests**: 5 passing tests (Worker functionality, Health endpoint, Login)
- **Failing Tests**: 8 failing tests (API endpoints, Utils, Auth)

## Root Causes of Test Failures

### 1. API Route Discrepancies

Several tests expect different API routes than what's actually implemented:

- **404 Errors** in `/places/` and auth tests
- Missing `/auth/me` route implementation

### 2. Missing Model Methods

The User model doesn't contain methods that tests are expecting:
- `get_by_username` method is missing

### 3. Missing API Functions

Tests are attempting to mock functions that don't exist in the API implementation:
- `api.endpoints.ingest.add_source_link`
- `api.endpoints.places.get_place_by_slug`

### 4. Utility Function Behavior Discrepancies

- `format_place_slug` treats apostrophes differently than expected
- The place extractor doesn't have the expected `nlp_processor` attribute
- Geocoder returns None instead of expected data structure

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Fix the User model**:
   - Add the `get_by_username` classmethod

2. **Update API routes to match tests**:
   - Implement or fix `/auth/me` endpoint
   - Check path mappings in routers

3. **Fix or update utility tests**:
   - Update slug function test expectations to match implementation
   - Check NLP extractor interface
   - Fix geocoder test with correct mocking

### Medium-term Improvements

1. **Add mock responses for all API routes**:
   - Ensure every API endpoint has a corresponding test
   - Use consistent mock patterns

2. **Add data generation utilities**:
   - Create helpers for generating test data
   - Make fixtures more reusable

3. **Add database validation tests**:
   - Test data persistence properly
   - Test relationships

### Long-term Enhancements

1. **Add integration tests**:
   - End-to-end tests for critical flows
   - Test the worker with real database connections

2. **Add performance tests**:
   - Ensure endpoints respond within acceptable times
   - Check worker efficiency

3. **Implement test coverage reporting**:
   - Set target coverage goals
   - Identify untested areas
